              -----------------------------

This LaTeX provides a simple environment for
technical reports as scholary publication.

NEU = Neumann
TR = Technical Report

As this class is created mainly for ourselves it does not
contain evil low-level TeX magic but instead uses many other
fancy LaTeX packages that we hope you have already installed.
